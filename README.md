** This mini-project was developed at the beginning of my studies at ENSEEIHT to learn the concepts of imperative programming. **

# Miniprojet-2-Structures-de-donnee-associative
Two Ada implementations of an associative data structure

## Associative Chained List
Firstly in the form of an Associative Chained List (LCA) which is based on a simple linear chained list where each cell contains a key, a data and an access to the next cell. 

## Hash Table
To improve the execution time, I used the principle of hash tables (TH) to realize this project. The idea is to use an array (thus a direct access) to store the data and a function, called a hash function, which from a key calculates the position of the data in the array. The value calculated by a hash function is called the hash value.
